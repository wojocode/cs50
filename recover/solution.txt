1. Camera wrtite to card in units of 512B
	- I define BYTE to store 1 byte of information, and used it later in fread and fwrite function to tell function that I want to read/write 512B once at a time until the end of the card
2. Read all of data from the card
	- I used while loop , because every time function fread read 512B return me value of 512, when it's nothing more to read ruturns 0 and loop will end
	- every loop I store this 512B in array - BYTE buffer[512]
3. set conditions for JPGE'S :
	1 if it's start of new JPG - searching for first four specific values
	2 continuation of previous - use attend argument in fopen function (this allows me to continue wrriting to file without loosing previous values)

another challenge was to create jpges files in specific oreder in format XXX.jpg (001.jpg, 002.jpg ...)
- I create string filename and allocate them 8 bytes for this format name (includeing /0 character) IMPORTANT ! every time I create a new filename i have to free(pointer)!
-  I use sprintf function to write my format name to my string filename - sprintf(filename, "%03i.jpg", i);
- I had to keep track how many jpg's i've created so i created i and set value to 0 and every time i created new jpgs increase i by 1
- if 512B wasn't start of new jpg i seted sprintf(filename, "%03i.jpg", i-1); last argument is i -1 because i have to target the same filnemane to continue writing
