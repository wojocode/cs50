1. read csv file to memory using:
    with open(nazwa pliku , "r") as file:
        reader = csv.DictReader(file)
        DictReader function return dictionary for each row
        - then iterate each row
        - convert string value to int
        - append team to list

simulate tournament
every round cuts down the group /2
we need only one team to return so we can use:
    while len(teams) > 1:
        teams = simulate_round(teams) # this divided teams /2
    return teams[0]["team"] - access to first element of a list
    and value of key - team
