IMAGE 
-digital image is a sequence of bits arranged in some fathion.
-almost every 24 bits represent some pixel's color. 
- bmp contains also meta data. 
- metadata is stored at the beginnig of the file in two forms of two structures 

how bottomup.c works 
- assign commend line argument argv[1] to pointer infile and argv[2] to outfile
	char *infile = argv[1]; 
- create pointer to infile FILE *inptr = fopen(infile,"r"); r means read from it 
- create outfile pointer FILE *outptr = fopen(outfile,"w"); w means write to it 
- Read infile's BITMAPFILEHEADER 
- create a vartiable to store information from inptr - BITMAPFILEHEADER bi;
