speller.c logic:
1 load dictionary into memory
2 read words by appending every character and put them to word and than check if it is in dictonary:
	1 open text
	2 read in while loop every character that is alphabetical and save it in char word[]
	3 if it's the end of a string set nul character with proper index to this word to get whole word to compare
	4 use check function to compare this word with dictionary:
	bool misspelled = !check(word);
		check function return true if word is in dictonary
		we need opossite to find misspelling
		so, if word isn't in dictionnery bool misspelled = !check(word) misspelled is now true - !(false) = true;

ps5 solution:
1. load function
	
2. check function:
	- call hash function to return index at the hash map array
	- create list in hash map - table[index] index is determine by hash function (first letter of a word)
	-
